# cpp-atmega32-drivers

This repository contains a collection of C++ drivers for the Atmega32 microcontroller. These drivers provide an abstraction layer to interact with various peripherals and components commonly used with the Atmega32.

## Getting Started

To get started with using these drivers in your Atmega32 projects, follow the installation and usage instructions provided in this README. Make sure you have the necessary hardware setup with an Atmega32 microcontroller and a compatible development environment.

## Supported Peripherals

The following peripherals are currently supported by the drivers:

- GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output)
- SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface)
- I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit)
- UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter)
- ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter)
- Timers
- Interrupts

## Installation

To use the drivers in your project, you can follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/cpp-atmega32-drivers.git
   ```

2. Copy the necessary driver files (`gpio.cpp`, `spi.cpp`, etc.) from the repository to your project directory.
   ex: mov gpio.cpp path_to_your_project_directory

3. Include the desired driver headers in your source files:

   ```cpp
   #include "gpio.h"
   #include "spi.h"
   // Include other driver headers as needed
   ```

4. Configure your development environment to include the necessary compiler flags and linker settings to build the drivers along with your project.

## Usage

To use a specific driver, follow these steps:

1. Include the corresponding driver header in your source file.

2. Create an instance of the driver class:

   ```cpp
   GPIO gpio(PA0, OUTPUT);
   ```

3. Use the driver functions to interact with the peripheral or component:

   ```cpp
   gpio.write(HIGH);
   ```

4. Refer to the driver documentation and examples provided in the repository for more detailed usage instructions and code samples.
